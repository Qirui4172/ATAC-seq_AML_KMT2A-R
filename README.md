# ATAC-seq_KMT2A-R_AML

Acute myeoloid leukemia mice with either of KMT2A-MLLT3 + FLT3-ITD, KMT2A-MLLT3 + FLT3-N676K, KMT2A-MLLT3 + NRAS-G12D, or KMT2A-MLLT3 + empty vector were ATAC sequenced using bone marrow.

Open chromatin regions were generated, annotated and compared. KMT2A-MLLT3 mice with either activating mutations of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-N676K or NRAS-G12D were compared to mice with KMT2A-MLLT3 alone, to find differential accessible regions (DARs).

Integrative analysis of ATAC-seq with RNA-seq was conducted to find significantly correlated peak-gene pairs, and their biological functions were examined.
